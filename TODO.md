 the purpose of this automation is to remove dependencies that are blockers for the install in non user controlled environments

## CLEANUP
 - add a DELETE function to remove all resources created by the automation
 - add wait periods for things that require a timeout between operations
 - chain everything togeather for simple 1 step automation
 - align file names of make files in correct order of operations
 - align scripts to make files index for easier location of scripts
 - align functiions to a proper naming convention
 - simplify 
 
 ## Alternate methods
 - provide terraform for the automation as an alternate GITOPS approach
 - convert scripts to ansible
